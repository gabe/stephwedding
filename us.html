<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Todd and Stephanie first met back in 2006 in Saskatoon, when
Stephanie first moved to the city and was a naïve young girl.
Life was not ready for them to be together and they parted their
ways only to meet again in the summer of 2011. The couple knew
immediately that they would spend the rest of their lives together.</p>
